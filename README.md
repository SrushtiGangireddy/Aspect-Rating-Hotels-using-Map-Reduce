# Aspect-Rating-Hotels-using-Map-Reduce

We took the data from the trip advisor.com.
Each hotel reviews were present in the JSON File.
We did pre processing on the data like parsing the json, aspect identification, data dictionary creation, aspect segmentation in java.

We then used hadoop map reduce to rank each hotel based on the aspect
We used the individual aspect weight to give overall rank to each hotel.
